═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MOTION FOR NUNC PRO TUNC TO CORRECT CLERICAL ERROR IN ORDER OF DISMISSAL AND TO CLARIFY STATUS OF REAL PARTY IN INTEREST
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
(Pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 316 and 329b(f))
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:
COMES NOW, Bill Wilburn, individually and as assignee of National Wholesale Realty, LLC (“Plaintiff”), and respectfully moves this Court under Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 316 and 329b(f) to correct a clerical error in the written Order Granting Defendant SOMOS Real Estate, LLC’s Motion to Dismiss Baseless Cause of Action, signed on or about December 26, 2024, and to clarify the Plaintiff’s standing as the real party in interest.
I. BACKGROUND
1. On December 18, 2024, this Court held a hearing on Defendant SOMOS Real Estate, LLC’s Rule 91a Motion to Dismiss. The Court’s notes and oral ruling reflected that the motion was “granted—no response” and that the case was “abated 30 days for Plaintiff to obtain counsel.”
2. No adjudication on the merits was made, and no “with prejudice” ruling was announced or intended.
3. However, the written Order signed December 26, 2024, includes language stating that the dismissal was “with prejudice” and references a “baseless cause of action.” This discrepancy constitutes a clerical error under Rules 316 and 329b(f) because it does not conform to the Court’s actual ruling.
4. Since that time, the Assignor, National Wholesale Realty, LLC, executed and filed an Assignment of Claims and Litigation Rights (filed October 10, 2025), duly transferring all rights and causes of action in this case to Bill Wilburn, individually.
5. As assignee, Plaintiff now holds standing as the real party in interest under Tex. R. Civ. P. 28 and Tex. Const. art. I, § 13 (Open Courts Clause). Accordingly, any prior procedural abatement requiring counsel for NWR is moot.
5A. For clarity, Plaintiff appears solely in his individual capacity as assignee and owner of the claims previously held by National Wholesale Realty, LLC. Plaintiff does not appear as an agent, representative, or attorney for the LLC in any respect. This distinction is explicit in the Assignment of Claims itself and fully comports with Rule 28 and Texas law on assignee standing.
6. At the hearing on October 28, 2025, concerning Defendant’s Plea in Abatement, Plaintiff appeared to clarify his standing. The Court, however, declined to hear Plaintiff, citing the prior standing order related to NWR’s corporate status.
7. The Court retains plenary power under Rule 329b(f) to correct its record and to ensure that its orders accurately reflect its actual rulings and the proper parties before it.

II. ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY
8. Rule 316 permits the Court to correct clerical mistakes in judgments or orders “at any time,” and Rule 329b(f) expressly allows such corrections while the Court retains plenary power.
9. Because the signed dismissal order includes language inconsistent with the Court’s announced ruling, correction nunc pro tunc is proper. See Andrews v. Koch, 702 S.W.2d 584, 585 (Tex. 1986).
10. Furthermore, Rule 28 authorizes an assignee to prosecute an action in his own name as the real party in interest, and nothing in Texas law prohibits an individual assignee from proceeding pro se on assigned claims.
11. Refusal to hear a properly filed motion or to recognize an individual party’s appearance constitutes a denial of due process. See Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965).
12. This Motion seeks only to correct the record and ensure procedural accuracy—not to reargue or reopen any merits determination.
III. REQUEST FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
1. Correct nunc pro tunc the December 26, 2024 Order to remove the words “with prejudice” and “baseless cause of action”;
 2. Clarify that the case remains active and subject to Plaintiff’s pending motions;
 3. Acknowledge that Bill Wilburn, individually and as assignee, is the lawful real party in interest and is not appearing as agent or representative for any entity;
 4. Set aside or vacate any inconsistent oral rulings entered at the October 28, 2025 hearing; and
 5. Grant such other and further relief as may be just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
