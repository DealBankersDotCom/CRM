III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
==================================================================

- 12/18/2024: Hearing held. Court notes: “M/T Dismiss – Granted (no response to 91a Motion)” 
              and “Case abated 30 days for Plaintiff to obtain counsel.” 
              No “with prejudice” ruling announced.

- 12/26/2024: Written Order signed stating “dismissed with prejudice” — language not matching court notes.
              Potential clerical error under TRCP 316 and 329b(f).

- 10/10/2025: Assignment of Claims and Litigation Rights filed, transferring all NWR claims to Bill Wilburn.

- 10/10/2025: Motion to Substitute Plaintiff filed.

- 10/24/2025: "Order to Dismiss" (unverified) filed; uncertain if actually signed by court.

    • Motion to Vacate or Correct Erroneous Orders
    • Emergency Motion to Reconsider and Clarify Real Party in Interest
    • Objection to Plea in Abatement
    • Supplemental Brief in Opposition
    • Motion for Nunc Pro Tunc to Correct Clerical Error in Order of Dismissal

- 10/28/2025: Hearing held. Court refused to recognize Plaintiff as real party in interest.
              Plaintiff warned speaking could constitute “criminal act.”
              Abatement ordered, possibly for 14 days.

- 11/04/2025: Docket confirms case remains OPEN (Pending). 
              No “Final Judgment” or “Closed” status recorded.

|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Standing / Assignment       | I am the lawful assignee under TRCP 28 and Tex. Const. art. I §13. The assignment is valid.    | NWR is defunct; only counsel can appear; standing order prohibits pro se action. | Filed assignment + motion to substitute.      | Opposed, mischaracterized as unauthorized.     |  |
| Clerical Error / 91a Order  | Dismissal “with prejudice” never announced; docket shows “no response” only.                   | 91a dismissal final and bars re-filing.                                          | Filed Nunc Pro Tunc under TRCP 316 / 329b(f). | Claimed dismissal final; relied on erroneous order. |  |
| Due Process                 | Denied opportunity to be heard; court threatened sanctions for speaking.                       | Court properly enforced prior order.                                             | Filed Emergency Motion to Reconsider.         | Argued prior orders bar participation.         |  |
| Procedural Defect (SOMOS)   | SOMOS order entered without appearance or authorization; void under TRCP 7 / 21b.              | No response yet; Crow acting beyond authority.                                  | To file Supplemental Notice.                  | Crow submitted order unilaterally.             |  |
| Plenary Power               | Court retains authority to correct record while case open.                                     | No, final orders control.                                                        | Filed within plenary period.                  | Misrepresented finality.                       |  |

==================================================================
VII. NOTES / STRATEGIC INSIGHT
==================================================================

- Case remains active. All filings accepted.
- SOMOS dismissal order likely entered without participation — key leverage.
- Clerk recognition of Plaintiff filings = implicit standing validation.
- Maintain tone: calm, procedural, constitutional (avoid emotion).
- Preserve audio from Oct 28 hearing for transcript (future appellate use).
- Avoid tipping hand about docket irregularities until certified order obtained.
- Possible next filings: Judicial Notice of Nonappearance (if needed); Motion to Compel Record Correction.
